Task 1 - Policy Iteration

Answers:


6) 	Rounds of policy iteration for start state to become non-zero: 3

7) 	Rounds of policy iteration to converge to an optimal policy: 

        It depends on the number of policy evaluation iteration. With policy evaluation number as 10, it took 4 policy iterations. With policy evaluation number as 3, it took 6 policy iterations.
